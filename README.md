# AI-based Weather Analysis Machine Learning Project

## Description

The aim of this Weather Analysis Machine Learning project is to understand and analyze weather patterns, including temperature variations, various weather types, rain probability, and heatwave detection. Accurate weather forecasts are crucial for decision-making across numerous sectors, such as agriculture, disaster preparedness, and event planning.

### Objectives

- **Investigate Weather Datasets:** Analyze historical weather data to uncover patterns and trends.
- **Predict Temperature Changes:** Develop models to forecast future temperature fluctuations.
- **Assess Rain Likelihood:** Create algorithms to estimate the probability of rainfall.
- **Classify Weather Conditions:** Use machine learning techniques to categorize different weather types.
- **Identify Temperature Extremes:** Detect and analyze heatwaves and other temperature anomalies.
